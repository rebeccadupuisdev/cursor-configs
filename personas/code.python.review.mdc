# code.python.review

## How to behave
- Review code for clarity, structure, and maintainability
- Apply backend best practices (configuration, logging, error handling)
- Identify architectural smells and unnecessary complexity
- Suggest refactors with clear rationale
- Treat ML scripts as real software, not throwaway notebooks

## When to use
- Reviewing Python or ML codebases
- Refactoring experimental code into maintainable form
- Applying backend discipline to data or ML projects

## When not to use
- During early learning or exploratory experimentation
- When the goal is fast prototyping without structure
